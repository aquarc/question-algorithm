    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"rationale\" : \"\"\"\n",
    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

    "#In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **New Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",

    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",

    "Argument AGAINST C: The modifier ‘upon recovering’ must refer to a person (Henry), not an abstract concept (‘reign’). The text says Henry fell ill, so only he—not his reign—can ‘recover.’  \n",
    "Conclusion: While C seems plausible, the modifier rule and textual context make A correct.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 5**:  \n",

       "\n",
       "**Question:** Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the team’s hypothesis?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Correct Answer:** B. The proportion of municipalities that responded to the inquiry or offered incentives didn’t substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**User's Answer:** D. Of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement date after the next election, more than 1,200 didn’t respond and only around 100 offered incentives.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments in favor of the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the \"after election\" scenario:** The user's answer focuses specifically on the municipalities that received inquiries about announcements *after* the election. The hypothesis suggests these municipalities should be *less* likely to respond or offer incentives.\n",
       "*   **Highlights a potential lack of interest:** The user's answer points out that a large number of municipalities didn't respond and only a small number offered incentives in the \"after election\" scenario. This could be interpreted as evidence supporting the idea that municipalities are less interested when there's no immediate electoral benefit.\n",
       "*   **Based on factual data:** The user's answer accurately reflects the data presented in the graph. The graph does show a large number of \"no response\" and a smaller number of \"offered incentive\" for the \"announcement after election\" condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments against the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lacks a crucial comparison:** The primary weakness of the user's answer is that it only describes the \"announcement after election\" condition. To *weaken* the hypothesis, we need to show that the \"announcement before election\" condition *doesn't* have a significantly different outcome. Without this comparison, we can't say whether the timing of the announcement truly matters. The hypothesis is about the *difference* between the two conditions.\n",
       "*   **Doesn't directly contradict the hypothesis:** While the user's answer shows a certain pattern in the \"after election\" data, it doesn't directly contradict the hypothesis. The hypothesis could still be true even if the \"after election\" group shows low response rates, as long as the \"before election\" group shows significantly *higher* response rates.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why the correct answer (B) is superior:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the core of the hypothesis:** The hypothesis is about whether the *timing* of the announcement affects municipal behavior. Choice B directly addresses this by stating that the proportion of municipalities that responded or offered incentives *didn't substantially differ* between the \"before\" and \"after\" conditions. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that timing matters.\n",
       "*   **Comparative:** Choice B makes a direct comparison between the two announcement timing conditions, which is essential for weakening the hypothesis. It states that there's no substantial difference, implying that the timing of the announcement doesn't have a significant impact on the municipalities' responses.\n",
       "*   **Supported by the graph:** By examining the graph, we can see that the bars for \"announcement before election\" and \"announcement after election\" are very similar for all three categories (no response, responded to inquiry, offered incentive). This visually supports the claim that there's no substantial difference between the two conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "While the user's answer (D) is factually correct and relevant to the question, it doesn't provide a strong argument against the hypothesis because it lacks a crucial comparison. The correct answer (B) is superior because it directly addresses the core of the hypothesis by stating that there's no substantial difference in municipal behavior across the two announcement timing conditions, and it is supported by the data presented in the graph.\n"

    "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, &ldquo;How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren&rsquo;t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film&rsquo;s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films&rsquo; unique stories and aren&rsquo;t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience&rsquo;s reactions to characters in animated films. </p>\n",

    "# Instruction\n",
    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "This evaluation rubric is purposefully vague, so take that as an opportunity to be strict and make sure the AI is really being useful for users.\n",
    "Be harsh with your feedback, but make sure your feedback is grounded in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, conciseness, and verbosity according to the criteria.\n",

       "The question tests your ability to ensure that modifying phrases clearly and logically refer to the correct subject in the sentence. According to the College Board, being able to correct errors in sentence structure is a key skill for success in the SAT writing section.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Why Choice A is Correct**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Clarity and Logic:** The phrase \"Upon recovering two years later\" is a modifying phrase. It describes *who* recovered. Choice A, \"Henry resumed his reign,\" places \"Henry\" immediately after the modifying phrase. This makes it clear that *Henry* is the one who recovered.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Why Other Choices are Incorrect**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dangling Modifiers:** Choices B, C, and D all create dangling modifiers. A dangling modifier is a phrase that doesn't clearly and logically attach to the subject it's intended to modify.\n",

       "    *   **Choice B:** \"the reign of Henry resumed\" - This implies the *reign* recovered, which doesn't make sense.\n",
       "    *   **Choice C:** \"Henry's reign resumed\" - Same as B, the *reign* cannot recover.\n",
       "    *   **Choice D:** \"it was Henry who resumed his reign\" - The word \"it\" is placed immediately after the introductory phrase, illogically suggesting that \"it\" recovered two years later.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Addressing Your Concern**\n",
       "\n",
       "You said: \"Isn't the subject that Henry got unfit to rule?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "You're right that Henry was initially unfit to rule. However, the sentence is structured with the phrase \"Upon recovering two years later...\" This phrase *must* logically modify the subject that comes immediately after it. The sentence is about what happened *after* Henry's illness, specifically, what happened when he got better.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Actionable Improvement Strategies**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Practice Identifying Modifiers:** Pay close attention to phrases that describe actions or states (like \"Upon recovering...\").\n",
       "*   **Check for Logical Connection:** After placing the subject, ask yourself, \"Does it make sense for *this subject* to be doing the action described in the modifying phrase?\"\n",
       "*   **Read the Sentence Aloud:** Sometimes, reading the sentence aloud can help you hear awkward phrasing or dangling modifiers.\n",
       "*   **Targeted Practice:** Do practice questions specifically focused on modifier placement. Review explanations carefully to understand why certain placements create errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Summary**\n",
       "\n",
       "The SAT writing section is very precise. Even if you understand the general idea of the sentence, you need to make sure the grammar and sentence structure are perfectly correct. In this case, the key was recognizing the modifying phrase and ensuring it logically connected to the correct subject (\"Henry\").\n"
