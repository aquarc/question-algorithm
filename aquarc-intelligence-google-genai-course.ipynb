    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",

While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

       "Question: In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
       "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
       "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
       "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
       "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
       "Correct Answer: A\n",
       "Correct Rationale: Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
       "User Answer: C\n",
       "User Rationale: Isn't the new method of ETL fabrication the same as the 'established methods'\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's think step by step:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Question Analysis: The question asks what the passage *most strongly suggests* about *conventional* ETL fabrication methods.\n",
       "2.  User Answer Analysis: The user believes the new spray coating method is an \"established method\" and therefore equal. They assumed conventional refers to all fabrication processes including new ones.\n",
       "3.  Correct Rationale Explanation: The passage says conventional ETL fabrication can be costly at scale, a problem spray coating may avoid, meaning at scale its likely more suitable. Answer A references exactly that. The passage doesn't give a comparison for fabrication on different solar cell designs so option B is unsupported, option C says a loss than *other established approaches* while in reality its spray coating that hasn't been, and option D changes effectiveness in fabrication (again an assumption since fabrication is how we put the materials in place and store light).\n",
       "4.  Comparative Feedback: The key word in your choice lies in 'established approach' but that approach actually is what can potentially reduce cost at scale compared to established methods which have the cost at scale. Be mindful that conventional solar cell fabrications refer to established methods in this scenario\n",

       "*   **Training Data:** If possible, fine-tune a language model specifically on a dataset of SAT questions, explanations, and student responses.  This will significantly improve performance.\n",
       "*   **User Rationale Handling:** Implement robust handling for cases where the `user_rationale` is missing. The model should be able to infer the user's reasoning based on their answer choice and provide feedback accordingly. You can modify all of the prompts here to take into consideration that if `user_rationale` does not exist then simply assume.\n",
       "*   **Testing and Iteration:** Thoroughly test all prompt variations with a diverse set of questions and student responses. Evaluate the quality and helpfulness of the feedback and iterate on the prompts as needed. You can provide these answers to me to refine it.\n",
       "*   **Context Length:** Be aware of the maximum token length that the model accepts. If your questions and rationales are very long, you may need to truncate them or use a model with a longer context window.\n",
       "*   **Security:** Sanitize all user input to prevent prompt injection attacks.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **New Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Examples**  \n",
    "### **Debate-Style Prompt (Question 4)**  \n",
    "**User Answer**: C (“Henry’s reign resumed”)  \n",
    "**Correct Answer**: A (“Henry resumed his reign”)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Good AI Response** (Rating 5):  \n",
    "*“Argument FOR C: A student might think ‘Henry’s reign’ is the subject because the prior sentence mentions Parliament appointing a ruler.  \n",
    "Argument AGAINST C: The modifier ‘upon recovering’ must refer to a person (Henry), not an abstract concept (‘reign’). The text says Henry fell ill, so only he—not his reign—can ‘recover.’  \n",
    "Conclusion: While C seems plausible, the modifier rule and textual context make A correct.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 5**:  \n",
    "- Uses debate structure to **preemptively address** the user’s assumption.  \n",
    "- Directly ties arguments to **textual evidence** (Henry’s illness/recovery).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor AI Response** (Rating 2):  \n",
    "*“FOR C: ‘Reign’ is a noun, so it matches the sentence structure.  \n",
    "AGAINST C: It sounds awkward.  \n",
    "Conclusion: A is better because it’s smoother.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 2**:  \n",

The graph clearly shows that for municipalities receiving inquiries with announcement dates *after* the election, a large number (over 1200) did not respond, and a small number (around 100, though closer to 120-130) offered incentives.\n",
       "*   **Weakening the Hypothesis (Potentially):** One could argue that this data *could* weaken the hypothesis. The hypothesis states municipalities are more likely to respond and offer incentives *before* an election. If municipalities are *unlikely* to respond or offer incentives *after* an election (as choice D suggests), this could be seen as supporting the idea that timing matters.\n",

       "**Arguments Against User's Answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lacks Comparative Context:** The *major* flaw in choice D is that it only presents data for the \"announcement after election\" condition. To *weaken* the hypothesis, we need to see if the \"announcement before election\" condition yields significantly *different* results. Without that comparison, we can't say whether the timing truly matters. It's possible that municipalities are generally unresponsive and disinclined to offer incentives, regardless of the timing.\n",
       "*   **Doesn't Directly Contradict the Hypothesis:** The hypothesis claims a *higher* likelihood of response before elections. Choice D simply describes the situation *after* the election. It doesn't directly contradict the \"before\" claim.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments for Correct Answer (B):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly Addresses the Hypothesis:** Choice B states that the proportion of municipalities that responded or offered incentives \"didn't substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.\" This *directly* challenges the core of the hypothesis, which is that timing *does* matter.\n",
       "*   **Comparative:** Choice B *explicitly* compares the \"before\" and \"after\" election conditions. This is crucial for evaluating the hypothesis. If the results are similar regardless of timing, the hypothesis is weakened.\n",
       "*   **Supported by the Graph:** Visually, the bars for \"announcement before election\" and \"announcement after election\" are very close in height for all three categories (no response, responded to inquiry, offered incentive). This supports the claim that there's no substantial difference.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why the Correct Answer (B) is Superior:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The correct answer (B) is superior because it directly addresses the core claim of the hypothesis (that timing matters) and provides a *comparative* analysis of the data, which is essential for weakening or supporting the hypothesis. Choice D, while factually accurate, only presents data for one condition and lacks the comparative element needed to effectively challenge the hypothesis. The question asks for the choice that *best* describes data that *weaken* the hypothesis. Choice B does this more effectively than choice D. The textual evidence in the graph, showing similar bar heights for both announcement timings, strongly supports choice B.\n"

The text begins with the underlined question, &ldquo;How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren&rsquo;t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film&rsquo;s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic.

Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it.

    "# Instruction\n",
    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "This evaluation rubric is purposefully vague, so take that as an opportunity to be strict and make sure the AI is really being useful for users.\n",
    "Be harsh with your feedback, but make sure your feedback is grounded in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles.

The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms&rsquo; morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms&rsquo; structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers&rsquo; decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count and Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s study.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference&mdash;it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.&nbsp;</p>'}\n"

Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist.

      "Birds of many species ingest foods containing carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benefits, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found that males in several species of the tanager genus *Ramphocelus* use microstructures in their feathers to manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper saturation without the birds necessarily having to maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings suggest that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential.

      "Geoglyphs are large-scale designs of lines or shapes created in a natural landscape. The Nazca Lines were created in the Nazca Desert in Peru by several Indigenous civilizations over a period of many centuries. Peruvian archaeologist Johny Isla specializes in these geoglyphs. At a German exhibit about the Nazca Lines, he saw an old photograph of a large geoglyph of a whalelike figure and was surprised that he didn’t recognize it. Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the figure from the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn’t already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "During the Bourbon Restoration in France (1814–1830), the right to vote required in part that a person paid at least 300 francs in direct taxes to the government. The four most common taxes (the *quatre vieilles*) were levied on real estate (both land and buildings); the doors and windows in taxpayer homes; the rental values of homes; and the businesses of artisans and merchants. (Foreign investments were either exempt from taxation or taxed lightly.) Although relatively few people paid the tax on real estate, it was the main means of voter qualification and accounted for over two-thirds of government receipts during this period, suggesting that during the Bourbon Restoration \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Researchers Suchithra Rajendran and Maximilian Popfinger modeled varying levels of passenger redistribution from short-haul flights (flights of 50 to 210 minutes, from takeoff to landing) to high-speed rail trips. Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn’t, so short-haul routes take similar amounts of time by air and by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge. Therefore, for rail to remain a viable alternative to short-haul flights, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Volunteering, or giving time for a community service for free, is a valuable form of civic engagement because helping in a community is also good for society as a whole. In a survey of youths in the United States, most young people said that they believe volunteering is a way to help people on an individual level.

    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

The debate-style prompt will be used for that purpose only. A button will be available for ToT processing, and the respective prompt will be subsituted for the query; at all other times, the user can ask specific questions or talk to the bot in an otherwise normal way.\n",
