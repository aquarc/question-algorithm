    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",

    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

       "*    **Length Restrictions:** Models like GPT can have \"lossy recalls\" if a lot of content or bulletpoints are used at the bottom, remember that there is a \"context window\". So the further down your information is, the more important information will become for getting results\n",

    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **New Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",

    "*“Argument FOR C: A student might think ‘Henry’s reign’ is the subject because the prior sentence mentions Parliament appointing a ruler.  \n",
    "Argument AGAINST C: The modifier ‘upon recovering’ must refer to a person (Henry), not an abstract concept (‘reign’). The text says Henry fell ill, so only he—not his reign—can ‘recover.’  \n",
    "Conclusion: While C seems plausible, the modifier rule and textual context make A correct.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 5**:  \n",
    "- Uses debate structure to **preemptively address** the user’s assumption.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Poor AI Response** (Rating 2):  \n",

       "\n",
       "**Question:** Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the team’s hypothesis?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Correct Answer:** B. The proportion of municipalities that responded to the inquiry or offered incentives didn’t substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**User's Answer:** D. Of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement date after the next election, more than 1,200 didn’t respond and only around 100 offered incentives.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments in favor of the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the \"after election\" scenario:** The user's answer focuses specifically on the municipalities that received inquiries about announcements *after* the election. The hypothesis suggests these municipalities should be *less* likely to respond or offer incentives.\n",
       "*   **Highlights a potential lack of interest:** The user's answer points out that a large number of municipalities didn't respond and only a small number offered incentives when the announcement was planned for after the election. This *could* be interpreted as supporting the idea that municipalities are less interested in incentives that don't benefit them electorally.\n",
       "*   **Based on factual data:** The user's answer is based on actual numbers that can be derived from the graph (approximately 1200+ municipalities didn't respond and around 100 offered incentives in the \"after election\" condition).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments against the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lacks a comparative element:** The critical flaw is that the user's answer only describes the \"after election\" scenario. To *weaken* the hypothesis, you need to show that the \"before election\" scenario is *not* significantly different. The hypothesis is about the *difference* between the two conditions.\n",
       "*   **Doesn't directly contradict the hypothesis:** While the data *could* be interpreted as supporting the hypothesis, it doesn't directly contradict it. It's possible that even in the \"after election\" scenario, *some* municipalities would still respond and offer incentives for other reasons.\n",
       "*   **Focuses on absolute numbers, not proportions:** The question asks about weakening the hypothesis, which is about the *likelihood* of response. The user's answer focuses on the absolute number of municipalities, which is less relevant than the proportion of municipalities responding in each condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why the correct answer (B) is superior:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the core of the hypothesis:** The hypothesis is about whether the *timing* of the announcement affects the likelihood of a response or incentive. Choice B directly states that the proportion of municipalities responding or offering incentives *didn't substantially differ* between the \"before\" and \"after\" conditions. This is a direct contradiction of the hypothesis.\n",
       "*   **Comparative:** Choice B explicitly compares the two conditions (\"across the announcement timing conditions\"), which is essential for weakening a hypothesis that is based on a comparison.\n",
       "*   **Stronger evidence:** If the proportions are similar, it suggests that the timing of the announcement is *not* a significant factor in the municipalities' decisions. This is much stronger evidence against the hypothesis than simply observing that some municipalities didn't respond in the \"after election\" condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Textual Evidence:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The graph shows the number of municipalities in each category. The long description provides the exact numbers:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **No Response:** Before Election: 1252, After Election: 1248\n",
       "*   **Responded to Inquiry:** Before Election: 207, After Election: 205\n",
       "*   **Offered Incentive:** Before Election: 128, After Election: 122\n",
       "\n",
       "The numbers are very close in each category, indicating that the timing of the announcement had little to no impact on the municipalities' responses. This directly supports choice B.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "While the user's answer is based on factual data from the graph, it fails to provide a comparative analysis that directly weakens the team's hypothesis. The correct answer (B) is superior because it explicitly states that the proportions didn't differ substantially across the announcement timing conditions, which directly contradicts the hypothesis.\n"

    "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, &ldquo;How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren&rsquo;t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film&rsquo;s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films&rsquo; unique stories and aren&rsquo;t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience&rsquo;s reactions to characters in animated films. </p>\n",

    "# Instruction\n",
    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "This evaluation rubric is purposefully vague, so take that as an opportunity to be strict and make sure the AI is really being useful for users.\n",
    "Be harsh with your feedback, but make sure your feedback is grounded in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
