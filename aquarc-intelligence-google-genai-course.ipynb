    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "rationale = \"\"\"\n",
    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

       "Okay, I can definitely clarify why answer C is incorrect and why A is the better choice, as well as address your question about the new method vs. established methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of the question, incorporating the official SAT framework:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Question Type:** Inference (Reading Comprehension)\n",
       "*   **Skill Tested:** Drawing conclusions based on explicitly stated information and understanding implications.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why Choice A is Correct:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The passage states that conventional ETL fabrication \"can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, *increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale*.\"\n",
       "*   It *then* contrasts this with spray coating, which the researchers describe as \"highly reproducible, concise, and practical,\" implying it *avoids* the cost issue.\n",
       "*   Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that conventional ETL fabrication is *less suitable* for large-scale manufacturing *than* the spray coating *alternative*.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why Choice C is Incorrect:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   This is where the careful wording of the question and answer choices becomes important. The passage *only* describes *one* conventional method: the nanoparticle solution method.\n",
       "*   The passage *doesn't* provide information about solution loss in *other* established approaches to ETL fabrication. We *only* know about the *one* conventional method mentioned.\n",
       "*   Thus, we *cannot* conclude that the nanoparticle solution method entails a *greater* loss *than other established approaches* because we have *no information* about those *other* approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Addressing your question:**\n",
       "\n",
       "You asked if the new method of ETL fabrication is the same as the 'established methods'. The answer is **no**:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The passage *contrasts* the \"conventional ETL fabrication\" (nanoparticle solution) with the *new* \"spray coating fabrication.\" The word \"conventional\" signals that nanoparticle solution is the current established method.\n",
       "*   The purpose of the passage is to highlight the *advantages* of the *new* spray coating method *compared to* the *existing* conventional method.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Choice A is a valid inference because the text *directly* links the conventional method to increased costs at scale, and *implies* that the alternative addresses this issue. Choice C makes a comparison that isn't supported by the text because the text only gives us information about *one* conventional method.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Actionable Improvement Strategy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Focus on Explicit vs. Implicit Information:** Practice distinguishing between what the text *directly states* and what you can *reasonably infer*. Be wary of answer choices that make comparisons or introduce information *not found in the passage.*\n",
       "2.  **Pay Close Attention to Comparative Language:** Notice words like \"more,\" \"less,\" \"greater,\" etc. Ensure the passage *explicitly* supports the comparison being made in the answer choice.\n",
       "3.  **\"One Word Wrong\" Tactic:** Sometimes, an answer choice can be very tempting, but one word can make it wrong. Train yourself to identify *that one word*. In this case, the phrase \"than do other established approaches\" introduces information that the passage doesn't support.\n",
       "\n",
       "I hope this explanation clarifies the reasoning behind the correct answer and helps you approach similar questions with more confidence! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n"
