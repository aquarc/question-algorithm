    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
    "\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"rationale\" : \"\"\"\n",
    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **New Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",

    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",

    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",

       "\n",
       "**Question:** Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the team’s hypothesis?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Correct Answer:** B. The proportion of municipalities that responded to the inquiry or offered incentives didn’t substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**User's Answer:** D. Of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement date after the next election, more than 1,200 didn’t respond and only around 100 offered incentives.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments in favor of the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the \"after election\" scenario:** The user's answer focuses specifically on the municipalities that received inquiries about announcements *after* the election. The hypothesis suggests these municipalities should be *less* likely to respond or offer incentives.\n",
       "*   **Highlights a potential lack of interest:** The user's answer points out that a large number of municipalities didn't respond and only a small number offered incentives in the \"after election\" scenario. This could be interpreted as evidence supporting the idea that municipalities are less interested when there's no immediate electoral benefit.\n",
       "*   **Based on factual data:** The user's answer is based on actual numbers that can be read from the graph (approximately 1200+ \"no response\" and around 100 \"offered incentive\" for the \"announcement after election\" condition).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments against the user's answer (D):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lacks a comparative element:** The core of the hypothesis is a *comparison* between the \"before election\" and \"after election\" scenarios. The user's answer only describes the \"after election\" scenario in isolation. To weaken the hypothesis, we need to show that the \"before election\" scenario is *not* significantly different.\n",
       "*   **Doesn't directly contradict the hypothesis:** While the user's answer shows a certain level of disinterest in the \"after election\" scenario, it doesn't prove that municipalities are *not* more likely to respond before an election. It's possible that the \"before election\" numbers are even *lower*, which would actually *support* the hypothesis (though this is not the case).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why the correct answer (B) is superior:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the comparative aspect of the hypothesis:** The correct answer explicitly states that there's no substantial difference in the proportion of municipalities that responded or offered incentives, regardless of the announcement timing. This *directly* contradicts the hypothesis that timing matters.\n",
       "*   **Encompasses all relevant data:** The correct answer considers both \"responded to inquiry\" and \"offered incentives,\" providing a more comprehensive assessment of the hypothesis.\n",
       "*   **Supported by the graph:** By visually comparing the heights of the \"before election\" (lighter) and \"after election\" (darker) bars for each category (\"no response,\" \"responded to inquiry,\" \"offered incentive\"), it's clear that the differences are minimal. This supports the claim that the announcement timing didn't have a significant impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Textual Evidence:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The graph shows that:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   \"Responded to inquiry\" is approximately 207 (before election) and 205 (after election).\n",
       "*   \"Offered incentive\" is approximately 128 (before election) and 122 (after election).\n",
       "\n",
       "These numbers are very close, indicating that the timing of the announcement had little to no effect on whether municipalities responded or offered incentives. This directly supports choice B.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "While the user's answer (D) identifies a factual observation from the graph, it fails to address the core comparative element of the hypothesis. The correct answer (B) directly contradicts the hypothesis by stating that there's no significant difference between the \"before election\" and \"after election\" scenarios, and this is supported by the data presented in the graph.\n"

    "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, &ldquo;How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren&rsquo;t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film&rsquo;s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films&rsquo; unique stories and aren&rsquo;t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience&rsquo;s reactions to characters in animated films. </p>\n",

    "EVAL_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n",
    "# Instruction\n",
    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "This evaluation rubric is purposefully vague, so take that as an opportunity to be strict and make sure the AI is really being useful for users.\n",
    "Be harsh with your feedback, but make sure your feedback is grounded in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, conciseness, and verbosity according to the criteria.\n",

       "Here's why:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Problem:** The sentence begins with a modifying phrase: \"Upon recovering two years later...\" This phrase needs to be followed by the noun it describes. If not, it's a dangling modifier.\n",
       "*   **Why A is Correct:** \"Henry resumed his reign\" correctly places \"Henry\" immediately after the modifying phrase, so it is clear that *Henry* is the one recovering.\n",
       "*   **Why you chose C:** \"Henry's reign resumed\" is grammatically correct on its own, but placing \"Henry's reign\" directly after the modifying phrase creates a dangling modifier. It illogically implies that the *reign* was the thing recovering. Although Henry is certainly the subject of the passage, the *reign* is the subject of the second half of the sentence.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Actionable Strategy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Focus on the closest noun:** When you see an introductory modifying phrase, ask yourself, \"What is *doing* the action described in this phrase?\" The answer should be the noun that comes immediately after the phrase.\n",
       "*   **Read carefully for meaning:** Sometimes, the correct answer sounds a little less natural. The SAT prioritizes grammatical precision over conversational ease.\n",
       "\n",
       "I hope this explanation helps clarify why option A is the best answer! Keep practicing, and you'll master these subtle grammar points.\n"
