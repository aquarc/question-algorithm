    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",

While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

       "**Prompt:** \"Question: In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication? A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be. B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures. C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication. D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power. Correct Answer: A. Explanation: Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem. Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. User Answer: C. User Rationale: Isn't the new method of ETL fabrication the same as the 'established methods'\"\n",

       "**Possible AI output**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The prompt centers on comparing one conventional method of electronic transport layer (ETL) with one recently invented method of ETL. It has a singular detail about the loss from one type of cell. The purpose of the question is for students to pick out exactly what the passage argues and not imply from their scientific or technical reasoning.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Choice A. is correct because of \"the cost of manufacturing at scale\" along with the end part of the sentence regarding \"spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” Therefore it makes sense that this alternative would have solved problems that were existing\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The user is misunderstanding conventional to mean the entire sphere of science when in actuality this excerpt only highlights ONE ETL that experiences loss. From here you should remember that extrapolation or inference from 1 detail onto other contexts in the SAT usually is wrong (exceptions apply!) If the problem gave data or described something different for the two entities in question than they would need to have differing arguments, as such there will always be key distinctions when doing 'weighing of evidence questions' that require more care to see their different properties\n",

    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **New Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Examples**  \n",
    "### **Debate-Style Prompt (Question 4)**  \n",
    "**User Answer**: C (“Henry’s reign resumed”)  \n",
    "**Correct Answer**: A (“Henry resumed his reign”)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Good AI Response** (Rating 5):  \n",
    "*“Argument FOR C: A student might think ‘Henry’s reign’ is the subject because the prior sentence mentions Parliament appointing a ruler.  \n",
    "Argument AGAINST C: The modifier ‘upon recovering’ must refer to a person (Henry), not an abstract concept (‘reign’). The text says Henry fell ill, so only he—not his reign—can ‘recover.’  \n",
    "Conclusion: While C seems plausible, the modifier rule and textual context make A correct.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 5**:  \n",
    "- Uses debate structure to **preemptively address** the user’s assumption.  \n",
    "- Directly ties arguments to **textual evidence** (Henry’s illness/recovery).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor AI Response** (Rating 2):  \n",
    "*“FOR C: ‘Reign’ is a noun, so it matches the sentence structure.  \n",
    "AGAINST C: It sounds awkward.  \n",
    "Conclusion: A is better because it’s smoother.”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a 2**:  \n",
    "- Creativity (debate) adds no educational value; arguments lack textual grounding.  \n",
    "- Fails to explain grammar rules or modifier placement.  \n",

       "The question asks us to identify the choice that *best* describes data from the graph that *weakens* the political scientists' hypothesis. The hypothesis is that municipalities are more likely to respond and offer incentives if the expansion announcement benefits local elected officials (i.e., before the election).\n",

       "*   **Argument for:** Choice B directly addresses the core of the hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts a difference in response based on announcement timing. If the proportion of municipalities responding or offering incentives is similar regardless of whether the announcement is before or after the election, this weakens the hypothesis. The graph visually confirms this similarity. The height of the bars for \"announcement before election\" and \"announcement after election\" are very close for each category (no response, responded to inquiry, offered incentive).\n",
       "*   **Argument against:** Choice B is somewhat abstract, referring to \"proportions\" and \"substantially differ.\" A more concrete answer might seem more appealing at first glance.\n",
       "\n",
       "**User's Answer: D**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Argument for:** Choice D presents factual data directly from the graph. It states that for municipalities receiving an inquiry with an announcement *after* the election, a large number didn't respond, and only a small number offered incentives. This seems to support the idea that municipalities are *less* interested when the announcement doesn't benefit them directly.\n",
       "*   **Argument against:** Choice D only focuses on the \"announcement after election\" condition. To weaken the hypothesis, we need to compare this data to the \"announcement before election\" condition. Without that comparison, we can't say whether the timing of the announcement makes a difference. It's possible that the response rate and incentive offers are low in *both* conditions, which would contradict the hypothesis.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why B is Superior**\n",
       "\n",
       "The key word in the question is \"weakens.\" To weaken the hypothesis, we need to show that the predicted difference based on announcement timing *doesn't* exist. Choice B does this by stating that the proportions are similar across both announcement timing conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Choice D, while factually correct about the \"announcement after election\" condition, doesn't provide the necessary comparison to the \"announcement before election\" condition. It's possible that the \"announcement before election\" condition also has a low response rate and few incentive offers, which would mean the timing doesn't matter, thus weakening the hypothesis. However, Choice D doesn't explicitly state this comparison, making it a weaker answer than Choice B.\n",

Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it.

    "# Define the evaluation prompt\n",
    "EVAL_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n",
    "# Instruction\n",
    "Evaluate the AI’s analysis of a student’s SAT error. Focus on how well it explains why the correct answer is textually supported and why the user’s answer is incorrect.\n",
    "This analysis is intended to build upon a previous debate style analysis where the user is presented upon a pro/con argument for their answer. These prompts will be used in the agent for when the user wants more clarity and multiple thinking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## **Metric Definition**\n",
    "Assess the **accuracy**, **completeness**, **groundedness**, and **clarity** of the response. The AI must:\n",
    "1. Correctly identify textual evidence for the correct answer.\n",
    "2. Explain flaws in the user’s answer (and their rationale, if provided).\n",
    "3. Follow the prompt’s instructions precisely.\n",
    "4. Really help the user understand why they were wrong by looking at how other people can mess up / how they potentially messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Instructional Creativity**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creative approach (e.g., debate, step-by-step analysis) **enhance understanding** of why the correct answer is textually supported?  \n",
    "   - Does it **strategically use the prompt’s structure** (e.g., arguments for/against) to highlight key SAT skills like evidence analysis or assumption identification?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Educational Effectiveness**:  \n",
    "   - Does the creativity **directly serve the learning goal** (e.g., clarifying misconceptions, modeling SAT logic), or is it merely ornamental?  \n",
    "   - Does it **engage the learner** while maintaining rigor (e.g., making complex reasoning more accessible)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Revised Rating Rubric**  \n",
    "- **5 (Excellent)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative structure (e.g., debate) **directly reinforces** why the correct answer is superior.  \n",
    "  - Uses the format to **explicitly contrast** the user’s error with textual evidence (e.g., “The strongest argument *for* the user’s answer is X, but the text contradicts this because Y”).  \n",
    "  - Balances creativity with precision and clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 (Good)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative approach is **mostly effective** but slightly misses opportunities to deepen understanding (e.g., lists arguments but doesn’t explicitly tie them to SAT skills).  \n",
    "  - Minor clarity issues in linking creativity to the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 (Adequate)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **distracts** slightly from the core analysis (e.g., overemphasizes hypothetical arguments without grounding in the text).  \n",
    "  - Fails to fully leverage the creative structure to address the user’s error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 (Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creative format **obscures key points** (e.g., hypothetical arguments misrepresent the text).  \n",
    "  - Prioritizes style over substance; minimal educational value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 (Very Poor)**:  \n",
    "  - Creativity **undermines accuracy** (e.g., invents textual evidence to support arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "This evaluation rubric is purposefully vague, so take that as an opportunity to be strict and make sure the AI is really being useful for users.\n",
    "Be harsh with your feedback, but make sure your feedback is grounded in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, conciseness, and verbosity according to the criteria.\n",
    "STEP 2: Score based on the rubric.\n",

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles.

The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms&rsquo; morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms&rsquo; structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers&rsquo; decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count and Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s study.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference&mdash;it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.&nbsp;</p>'}\n"

Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist.

      "Birds of many species ingest foods containing carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benefits, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found that males in several species of the tanager genus *Ramphocelus* use microstructures in their feathers to manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper saturation without the birds necessarily having to maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings suggest that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential.

      "Geoglyphs are large-scale designs of lines or shapes created in a natural landscape. The Nazca Lines were created in the Nazca Desert in Peru by several Indigenous civilizations over a period of many centuries. Peruvian archaeologist Johny Isla specializes in these geoglyphs. At a German exhibit about the Nazca Lines, he saw an old photograph of a large geoglyph of a whalelike figure and was surprised that he didn’t recognize it. Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the figure from the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn’t already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "During the Bourbon Restoration in France (1814–1830), the right to vote required in part that a person paid at least 300 francs in direct taxes to the government. The four most common taxes (the *quatre vieilles*) were levied on real estate (both land and buildings); the doors and windows in taxpayer homes; the rental values of homes; and the businesses of artisans and merchants. (Foreign investments were either exempt from taxation or taxed lightly.) Although relatively few people paid the tax on real estate, it was the main means of voter qualification and accounted for over two-thirds of government receipts during this period, suggesting that during the Bourbon Restoration \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Researchers Suchithra Rajendran and Maximilian Popfinger modeled varying levels of passenger redistribution from short-haul flights (flights of 50 to 210 minutes, from takeoff to landing) to high-speed rail trips. Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn’t, so short-haul routes take similar amounts of time by air and by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge. Therefore, for rail to remain a viable alternative to short-haul flights, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_blank\n",

      "Volunteering, or giving time for a community service for free, is a valuable form of civic engagement because helping in a community is also good for society as a whole. In a survey of youths in the United States, most young people said that they believe volunteering is a way to help people on an individual level.

    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",

The debate-style prompt will be used for that purpose only. A button will be available to view alternative approaches to the problem, and the respective prompt will be subsituted for the query; at all other times, the user can ask specific questions or talk to the bot in an otherwise normal way.\n",

      "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",

      "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
      "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
      "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
      " \n",

While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",
