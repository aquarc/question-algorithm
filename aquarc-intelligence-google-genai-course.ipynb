    "In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. described a method for fabricating the cell’s electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?\n",
    "A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.\n",
    "B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.\n",
    "C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.\n",
    "D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "rationale = \"\"\"\n",
    "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication. \n",

       "Okay, I can definitely see why you chose option C, and I'm happy to clarify!\n",

       "Here's a breakdown of why A is correct and why C isn't quite the best fit, according to the SAT's focus:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Question Type:** This is an **inference question**. (Reading: Information and Ideas). You need to understand what the passage strongly suggests, even if it's not directly stated.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why Choice A is Best:** The passage explicitly states that conventional ETL fabrication \"can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale.\" The passage then suggests that spray coating fabrication *may* solve this problem. This strongly implies that the conventional method is *less suitable* for large-scale manufacturing *than* this alternative *may* be.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why Choice C is Tricky But Ultimately Wrong:**\n",
       "    *   You're right to focus on the \"loss of nanoparticle solution.\" The passage *does* say the conventional method loses a lot of solution.\n",
       "    *   However, the key word here is \"**other established approaches**\". The passage *only* describes one conventional method. We don't know if other conventional ETL fabrication methods also have high solution loss or not. For all we know, this conventional method could be the *only* established approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In short:** Choice A is a more direct inference based on the explicit comparison the author makes between the conventional method and the *potential* benefits of the spray coating method for large-scale manufacturing. Choice C makes an assumption about \"other established approaches\" that isn't supported by the text.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to Improve:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Focus on Direct Comparisons:** When the SAT presents a comparison (like \"Method A\" vs. \"Method B\"), pay close attention to the specific advantages and disadvantages the author attributes to each.\n",
       "2.  **Avoid Making Assumptions:** Be careful not to add your own information or assumptions to the passage. Stick strictly to what the text says.\n",
       "3.  **\"Strongly Suggests\" Means Strong Evidence:** The phrase \"most strongly suggests\" is a clue to look for the answer choice that has the *most* direct support in the passage.\n",
       "\n",
       "I hope this helps clarify the reasoning! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"
